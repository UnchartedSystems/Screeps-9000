## Economy

Worker Uptime

- Workers are always working towards productive investments
- Workers transition from loading Spawner energy to building extensions

Productive Investments

- Investments that pay off 
- Is throughput (extra spawner) worth the upfront cost (3000)?
- Extensions can allow transitioning from low value to high value parts (tough => heal)

Build Reactivity

- Build AntiKiters if facing Kiters
- Scale builds to excess extension energy
